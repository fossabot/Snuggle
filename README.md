Unity Processor

Snuggle is NOT feature complete and there is NO ETA on when it will be. Use [AssetRipper](https://github.com/AssetRipper/AssetRipper/) or [AssetStudio](https://github.com/Perfare/AssetStudio) as both are more feature rich and stable.

## Snuggle and it's contributors are not affiliated with, or sponsored by, or authorized by, Unity Technologies.

### Feature Level Comparison 

Snuggle's only benefit over other systems is the ability load large games without running out of memory due to Snuggle having deferred loading. Heavy assets such as textures and models are not fully loaded until they're accessed.
